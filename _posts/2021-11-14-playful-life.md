## Gamifacation

If you ever played a game (be it board or digital), you just might know the feeling. Hours gone by. Lots of amusement. Not a lot of worrying. It's like you escaped into some parallel realm, where the mundane problems and duties of everyday life ceased to exist. Once the illusion is broken, and you retire from the game after a few hours, life kicks in and you remember that you are baking potatoes in the oven.\
The troubles are back.

I admit, it's not like you are amused *all the time*. Even in a game, you just might fail. But I'm sure you agree, that if you do fail, you are more likely to keep pushing on - to press "try again" - compared to a failure outside the game.

How does the game differ from real life? On a million points, yes. But lets gather these into two major (critical) points:

* You are **not** the game (character)
* You **know** that if you push on, the game will reward you

If we could change our metaconginitive beliefs, to be more *game like*, we just might have a recipe to live life in the playful manner that we all want.

## You are not the game

It is with the game, as it is with life. You are not this life. You will always be less important, than you might believe or want yourself to be. But that realisation should strengthen you, and not diminish you. 

If **you** are not that important, then perhaps you should focus on what **you can do**. Detach yourself from you, and let that *you* be an instrument to own the game of life. 

When you detach yourself from *you*, you will experience a number of things.  Since *you* are no longer the object of interest

* You become less selfish.
* You stop to ponder about *your life*. You become present.
* You become focused, since there are fewer personal distractions.
* Life becomes fun! You have less reason to worry.
