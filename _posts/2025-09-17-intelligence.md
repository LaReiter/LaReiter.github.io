  <figcaption><strong>Figure:</strong>  Top row shows (fictitious) distributions of number of correct answers in an intelligence test — the higher the curve, the more people score in that interval. Bottom row shows the same results translated to a standardized intelligence scale (bell curve). (A) Most get few correct; to be in top 2% requires >30 correct. The distance between a typical person (median) and top 2% is 15 answers. (B) The distribution is symmetrical around 22 correct; top 2% requires >34 correct, and the difference from the median is 12. (C) Many score high; top 2% requires >43 correct, and the difference from the median is 9. Conclusion: When more people score higher on the test, the threshold for reaching the top 2% increases, while the difference in number of correct answers between a typical person and the highly gifted becomes smaller.</figcaption>

Intelligence is measured by comparing the number of correct answers on an intelligence test with the number of correct answers among a representative, contemporary sample. If you then rank all test participants from lowest to highest according to how many correct answers they have, and look at the lowest number of correct answers among the top 2 percent, you have the entry requirement for Mensa.

Note that I wrote a representative, contemporary sample. What happens if, instead, you measure your score against a representative sample of people from 10 years ago? What you find is that the number of correct answers required to qualify for Mensa would be lower than it is today. In fact, your intelligence quotient (on average) would be about three points higher if you took the test back then. If you compared your score with people from 20 years ago, the increase would be about six points on average. Compared with people from 30 years ago, about nine points — and so on. This is called the Flynn effect. The effect is named after philosopher and intelligence researcher James Flynn, who in 1984 documented a rise in IQ test scores among Americans — and later also across countries. However, it took 10 years before the phenomenon became known as “the Flynn effect,” following the publication of The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life (1994), a book written by psychologist Richard Herrnstein and sociologist Charles Murray. Today, the Flynn effect is widely recognized [1, 2].

Studies suggest that the effect is environmentally determined, and that it is fluid (as opposed to crystallized) intelligence that increases [3]. Concrete explanations include better health and nutrition, as well as a cultural shift toward more abstract thinking. Some studies indicate that the effect is most pronounced in the lower percentiles (the group of the “less” intelligent) [4], consistent with the idea that they experience the greatest relative improvements in health. Under this assumption, one consequence is that the raw scores in intelligence tests shift toward a more left-skewed distribution (situation C in the figure above), where the distance — measured in the number of correct answers on an intelligence test — between the highly gifted (top 1–2 percent) and the rest gradually becomes smaller and smaller. It should be noted, however, that the Flynn effect is still not fully understood. For example, some studies have found that the effect may even be negative (that is, people score lower on IQ tests today) [5].

If we nonetheless assume a positive Flynn effect that is strongest in the lower and middle percentiles, Mensa members may have to get used to the idea that a relatively larger proportion of the population will resemble “us” in terms of cognitive abilities (at least those described by IQ scores). So even though a person in the top 2% and a person in the top 50% intuitively must be different, it could theoretically end up being the case that the real difference is quite modest. Under such a scenario, one might ask whether the current division of intelligence levels is meaningful at all — or whether it would make more sense to think in terms of just two broad classes: the gifted and the less gifted.
