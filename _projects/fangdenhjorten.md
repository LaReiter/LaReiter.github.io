The game was developed during the summer, 2013. My small nephew was chasing my brother Morten, who had taken his soccer ball. Kids sometimes misspronounce names, and Morten easily came out sounding like "Hjorten". The title of the game thus became "Fang Den Hjorten" (Catch that Hjorten). At this point in time, I was on my first year of Natural Science and IT, and wanted to familiarize myself with game programming using Python. This became my first personal python project.

### PyGame

PyGame is a Python package that makes it easy to create 2D games and other interactive applications. It handles all the tedious stuff - like drawing graphics, playing sounds, and detecting when keys are pressed - so you can focus on the fun parts of game development. What I found particularly appealing about PyGame is how it removes the barriers between having a game idea and actually building it. You don't need to wrestle with complex graphics engines or low-level programming. Instead I was able to quickly prototype my silly game concept while sitting in our summerhouse. PyGame is built on SDL, allowing for cross-platform compatability so I do not have to worry about the annoying bits of making the code work across different operating systems.
