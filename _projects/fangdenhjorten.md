The game was developed during the summer, 2013. My small nephew was chasing my brother Morten, who had taken his soccer ball. Kids sometimes misspronounce names, and Morten easily came out sounding like "Hjorten". The title of the game thus became "Fang Den Hjorten" (Catch that Hjorten). At this point in time, I was on my first year of Natural Science and IT (NATIT), and wanted to familiarize myself with game programming using Python. This became my first personal python project.

### PyGame

PyGame is a Python package that makes it easy to create 2D games and other interactive applications. It handles all the tedious stuff - drawing graphics, playing sounds, and detecting when keys are pressed - so I could focus on the fun parts of game development. PyGame is built on Simple DirectMedia Layer Library, which means that many performance-heavy operations (like graphics rendering and audio processing) are handled under the hood in C-code, while I can structure my game in python syntax. What I found particularly appealing about PyGame is how it removes the barriers between having a game idea and actually building it. You don't need to wrestle with complex graphics engines or low-level programming, instead I was able to quickly prototype my silly game concept while sitting in the summerhouse.

### What I learned?

During my first year on NATIT, I been doing a lot of functional programming. This was my first big object-oriented project where I quickly discovered the strength of classes and objects. I also learned about new concepts, such as sprites and making user interfaces. I leraned about collision detection algorithms, event handling and general game architecture. Since this project involved many versions and multiple lines of code, I also learned a fair share about version-control and code management/documentation.
