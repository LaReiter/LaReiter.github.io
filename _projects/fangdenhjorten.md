The game was developed during the summer 2013. My nephew was chasing my brother Morten, who had taken his soccer ball. Kids sometimes misspronounce names, and Morten easily came out sounding like "Hjorten" which is danish for "The Deer". The title of the game thus became "Fang Den Hjorten" (Catch that "The Deer"). At this point, I was in my first year of Natural Science and IT (NatIt), and wanted to familiarize myself with game programming using Python. This became my first personal python project. The standalone (python) file and assets is available <a href="https://github.com/LaReiter/PyGame---FangDenHjorten" target="_blank">on my Github</a>.

### PyGame

PyGame is a Python package that makes it easy to create 2D games and other interactive applications. It handles all the tedious tehnical stuff - drawing graphics, playing sounds, and detecting when keys are pressed -while letting me focus on the actual game logic. PyGame is built on Simple DirectMedia Layer Library, which means the performance-heavy operations get handled efficiently in C under the hood, while I could structure everything in Python syntax I was comfortable with. This setup meant I could go from "wouldn't it be funny if..." to actually seeing something work on screen without getting bogged down in low-level programming. I could just sit in the summerhouse and prototype my ridiculous deer-soccer concept piece by piece. Check out the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/" target="_blank">PyGame documentation</a>.

### What I learned?

During my first year at NatIt, I had been doing mostly functional programming. This was my first big object-oriented project, where I quickly discovered the strength of classes and objects. I also learned about new concepts like sprites and user interfaces. I dove into collision detection algorithms, event handling, and general game architecture. Since the project involved many iterations and hundreds of lines of code, I also picked up valuable skills in version control and code documentation.
