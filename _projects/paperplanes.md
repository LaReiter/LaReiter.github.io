    Some of my (re)creations showing different types of paper planes. Some are small, some are big. Some are pointy, and some with a large wingspans. Finally, some are bionic and flaps their wings like a bird of bat. The paper plane with the rockets has limited flight capability but looks amazing.

As a kid I loved to fold paper airplanes. So much, that I bought myself a textbook on the mechanics and aerodynamics of paper planes. The book also included several colorful templates to be used. Now that my kid reached has reached the same age and independently shown an interest in the subject, Iâ€™ve found it deeply satisfying to revisit my old hobby.

Despite my satisfaction in simply folding the planes, the academic within me wanted to do some experimenting. So I decided I wanted to test how the number of folds on a standard paper plane influence the flight duration.
