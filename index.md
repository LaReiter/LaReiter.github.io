It is interesting how the curiosity of a toddler often checkmates mature people, when confronted with questions about the natural order of the world. Eventually, our curiosity burns out, and we learn to stop asking questions. For me, there is nothing more meaningful, than experiencing life both on a aesthetical level and on a intellectual level. To do that, we need to be a todler again. 
And start asking questions.

In my **CV**, I attempted to chop down the complexity of a human life to bulletpoints and taglines. Go ahead and read it. In my **blog** I will take you on a coaster ride in my mind, where major and minor ideas will be discussed, intellectual investigations carried out and paradoxical events pointed out.
