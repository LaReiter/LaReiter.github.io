**Welcome to my homepage**
A pathway to the mind of a passionate Physics graduate, Statistics student and explorer of life.
I am inquisitive and analytical by heart. I am a statistician and a physicist
deeply fascinated by the applicability of the rich mathematical theory that precedes numerous technological and intellectual achievements today.
I'm particular fascinated by the mathematical theory contained in statistical machine learning. I crunch numbers on a daily basis,
and find huge satisfication in tackling and succeeding with the big data
puzzles (=problems) that pops up in this age of the machine.
