# Welcome to My World of Data & Discovery

<img align="right" src="/assets/expl2.png" width="300" style="margin-left: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">

With triple graduate degrees in Physics, IT and Statistics, I consider myself a exponential nerd.

What drives me? The elegant beauty of mathematical theory and its incredible power to solve real-world problems. From the quantum problems of our universe to big data analytics of companies, I'm fascinated by how abstract mathematical concepts pushes us forward.

## Current Research & Projects

Given my different backgrounds I also enjoy interdisciplinary challenges, this includes

🔬 **Arctic Wildlife Analytics** - Developing novel statistical methods to understand narwhal behavior patterns in changing Arctic conditions, and population dynamics

⚡ **Power Grid Modeling** - Extending the capacity map for Denmark's national energy provider (Energinet), and playing with physical kuramoto-like stochastic models to explore grid stability

📊 **Behavioural Science** - Advancing methodologies for understanding cause-and-effect relationships in behavioural science
