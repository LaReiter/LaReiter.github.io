**Welcome to my homepage**
A pathway to the mind of a passionate Physics graduate, Statistics student and explorer   of life.

I am inquisitive and analytical by heart. I am a statistician (as well as a physicist)
deeply fascinated by the mathematical theory contained in data science, in
particular within machine learning. I love puzzles of all sorts, and to solve
small and large scale problems of mathematical nature. I crunch numbers on a daily basis,
and find huge satisfication in tackling and succeeding with the big data
problems that pops up in this age of the machine
