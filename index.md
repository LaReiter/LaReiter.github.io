# Welcome to My World of Data & Discovery

<img align="right" src="/assets/expl.png" width="300" style="margin-left: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">

Hello! I'm a passionate explorer at the intersection of **Physics**, **Statistics**, and **Machine Learning**. With dual graduate degrees in Physics and Statistics, I spend my days unraveling the mathematical mysteries that power today's technological breakthroughs.

What drives me? The elegant beauty of mathematical theory and its incredible power to solve real-world problems. From quantum mechanics to big data analytics, I'm fascinated by how abstract mathematical concepts become the foundation for revolutionary discoveries.

## What I Do

I'm a data scientist and researcher who transforms complex problems into actionable insights. My work spans from developing statistical models for Arctic wildlife research to analyzing power systems using cutting-edge mathematical frameworks.

**My expertise covers:**
- **Statistical Machine Learning** with a focus on causal inference
- **Bayesian Methods** and advanced regression modeling  
- **Complex Systems Analysis** in physics and data science
- **Big Data Analytics** and algorithmic development

## Current Research & Projects

üî¨ **Arctic Wildlife Analytics** - Developing novel statistical methods to understand narwhal behavior patterns in changing Arctic conditions

‚ö° **Power Grid Modeling** - Extending capacity mapping models for Denmark's national energy provider (Energinet)

üìä **Causal Inference Research** - Advancing methodologies for understanding cause-and-effect relationships in complex datasets
