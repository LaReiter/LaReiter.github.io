**Welcome to my homepage**.
A pathway to the mind of a passionate Physics graduate, Statistics graduate and explorer of life.
I am inquisitive and analytical by heart. I am deeply fascinated by the applicability of the rich mathematical theory that precedes numerous technological and intellectual achievements of today.
I'm particular interested in the mathematical theory contained in statistical machine learning, and the adaption of causality as a primary focus area. I crunch numbers on a daily basis,
and find huge satisfication in tackling and succeeding with the big data
puzzles (=problems) that pops up in this age of the machine.
