"Why is my nail setting on my finger? If it was on my nose, it'd be fun"

This was one of the many questions asked in the children's book "Spørge jørgen" - a tale of a boy whose endless questions drove his parents mad. I loved this book as a kid. And I love it even more as an adult. Not only because it is silly and fun, but also because it reminds me not to take life and all its marvels for granted. And to never let myself get detached from those small magical things that present themself in each moment. 

Life fascinates me, and I dedicate much of my time to explore every bit of it. From the synchronized movements of fish schools to the invisible dark matter that makes up most of our universe, from the unspoken rules that govern social interaction to the mysteries of human consciousness.
