  <p>"Why is my nail on my finger? If it were on my nose, it would be fun." - Spørge Jørgen</p>

<div class="content-text">
This was one of the many questions asked in the children's book "Spørge Jørgen" - a tale of a boy whose endless questions drove his parents mad. I loved this book as a kid. And I love it even more as an adult. Not only because it is silly and fun, but also because it reminds me how wondrous life is - and how many things we do not fully understand. As we grow older, our curiosity surrounding the small splendors of life seems to fade, and if we are not careful, life becomes dull.

Life fascinates me, and I dedicate much of my time to explore every bit of it. From the synchronized movements of fish schools to the invisible dark matter that makes up most of our universe, from the unspoken rules that govern social interaction to the mysteries of human consciousness.

What I particularly love about life, is that it offers a buffet of intellectual problems waiting to be solved or better understood. This requires critical thinking and analytical skills, and for me usually results in reader's letters, research based projects as well as other creative projects. For example, I sat on my terrace and tracked the movement of a harvestman carefully with the hope of understanding its movement patterns through stochastic modelling. I made my own survey to understand which criteria parents value when they choose their kids name, and how this has changed over generations. I also made my own python-based game (using the package PyGame) in my summer vacation - a game that was inspired by some soccer-variant we came up with in the summerhouse. A full list of my projects and reader's letters can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/YOUR_ACTUAL_DOC_ID/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. Selected projects are are presented here on the homepage.
